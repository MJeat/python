Data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.

Example: Family tree

Different data structure creates different way to store and organize data.

Data structure is like a raw material for building something. Programmers need to pick the right materials to build a project.

Yes, the names for various data structures can differ between programming languages, but their core functionalities and principles generally remain the same. The terminology might vary, but the underlying concepts and operations are similar. Hereâ€™s a summary comparing some common data structures across different programming languages:

For Array:
In python is called list. In Java is called...

Python: list (dynamic array with additional functionalities)
Java: Array (fixed size), ArrayList (dynamic array)
C++: array (fixed size), vector (dynamic array)
JavaScript: Array


Hash Table:

Python: dict
Java: HashMap, Hashtable
C++: unordered_map
JavaScript: Object (used as a map), Map


Linked List:

Python: Implemented manually using class
Java: LinkedList
C++: list
JavaScript: Implemented manually using class



Stack:

Python: list (using append and pop), collections.deque
Java: Stack, ArrayDeque
C++: stack
JavaScript: Array (using push and pop)



Queue:

Python: collections.deque, queue.Queue
Java: Queue (interface), LinkedList (class implementing Queue)
C++: queue
JavaScript: Array (using push and shift)



Set:

Python: set
Java: HashSet, TreeSet
C++: set, unordered_set
JavaScript: Set



Tree:

Python: Implemented manually using class, collections.defaultdict for simple trees
Java: TreeMap, TreeSet for specific tree implementations
C++: map (Red-Black Tree), set (Red-Black Tree)
JavaScript: Implemented manually using class
