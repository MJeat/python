# Graph:



# 2 types of graph in DSA
# Undirected and directed graph

# Undirected graph like FB

# Each node(vertex) represent users. Edge is a connection.
# If 2 nodes are connected, they have adjacency.

# Directed graph: a one direction connection.

# @ popular ways to reprent graph:
    # Adjacency matrix and adjancency list



# Adjacency matrix: very quick to use when having a lot of edges, but slow cuz space
    # Time complexity: O(1)
    # Space complexity: O(n^2), n: numbers of node



# Adjacency list: a bunch of linkedlist with more lists within each linkedlist

    # Use less space
    # Time complexity: O(n) 
    # Space complexity: O(n + E), E: number of edges, n: number of nodes
