Case 1: Movie Ticket Pricing

Develop a program that determines the movie ticket price based on age, day of the week, and movie time. Offer discounts for children, seniors, and matinee shows. Handle edge cases like holidays and special events with unique pricing rules.

Case 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. Generate the computer's move randomly and use nested "if" statements to determine the winner and display appropriate messages. Offer a best-of-three option.

Case 3: FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz", numbers divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and numbers divisible by both with "FizzBuzz". Use nested "if" statements to achieve this efficiently.

Case 4: Leap Year Check

Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules. Incorporate nested "if" statements to handle both common and centuries, considering exceptions like the years divisible by 400.

Case 5: Vowel or Consonant Classifier

Develop a program that takes a character as input and classifies it as a vowel, consonant, or special symbol using nested "if" statements. Handle uppercase and lowercase letters appropriately.

Case 6: Temperature Adviser

Write a program that provides temperature advice based on user input. Consider the following conditions:
- If the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, print "It's freezing, stay indoors."
- If the temperature is between 0 and 10 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print "Wear a warm jacket."
- If the temperature is between 11 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print "It's a pleasant day."
- If the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius, print "Enjoy the sunny weather."
- If it's raining (ask the user for input), add appropriate advice.

Case 7: GPA Calculator

Create a GPA calculator program. Ask the user for the number of courses and their corresponding grades. Calculate the GPA based on the standard grading scale (A: 4.0, B: 3.0, C: 2.0, D: 1.0, F: 0). Provide additional feedback if the GPA is above a certain threshold.

Case 8: Number Guessing Game

Create a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player keeps guessing until they match the number, with hints provided ("higher" or "lower") after each guess. Track and display the number of guesses taken.

Case 9: Traffic Light Simulator

Implement a simple traffic light simulation using conditional statements. The light cycles through red, yellow, and green states based on predefined durations, incorporating a pedestrian button that changes the light sequence appropriately.
