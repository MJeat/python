# python

Hello, this is a repository for my Python learning. It is diverse as it contains everything about Python that I learned in University, either school projects or small personal projects that I was inspired to create. 

In the future, I plan to have a separate Python for Cybersecurity, small personal projects, or Ethical Hacking tools
